## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `static/src/css`: Contains all the SASS files for the theme.
- `static/src/js`: Contains all the JavaScript files for the theme.
- `views`: Contains all the XML files for the theme.
- `models`: Contains all the Python files for the theme.

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript

We use ES6 syntax in our JavaScript files. Here's an example of how to define a function:

```javascript
const myFunction = () => {
  // function body
};
```

### SASS

We use nested syntax and variables in our SASS files. Here's an example:

```scss
$primary: #0D0D0D;
$secondary: #15E8B5;
$accent: #FF3E4D;

body {
  color: $primary;
  
  h1 {
    color: $secondary;
  }
}
```

### Python

We follow PEP 8 style guide in our Python files. Here's an example:

```python
def my_function():
    # function body
    pass
```
